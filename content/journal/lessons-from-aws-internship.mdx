Three months at AWS felt like a year of learning compressed into a summer. Working on the EC2 ZIM Core Team in Arlington, VA, I got to design and build systems that would be used at AWS scale. As I wrap up my internship, here are the lessons I'll carry forward.

## The Surprises

### 1. The Scale Is Real

I expected large systems. I didn't expect every decision to have scale implications. When you're building for AWS, even a small inefficiency can multiply into significant problems.

**The lesson**: Design for scale from day one. The extra time spent on optimization upfront pays off exponentially.

### 2. GraphQL Changes Everything

My main project was building a GraphQL-based proof of concept for querying EC2 network interface data. Moving from REST to GraphQL wasn't just a technical change—it fundamentally shifted how we thought about APIs.

```graphql
# Instead of getting everything and filtering client-side
# Clients could request exactly what they needed
query {
  networkInterface(id: "eni-12345") {
    privateIpAddress
    subnetId
    securityGroups {
      groupId
    }
  }
}
```

The result: **80% reduction in payload size** and sub-second latency for complex queries.

**The lesson**: The right abstraction can dramatically simplify problems. GraphQL wasn't just "better REST"—it was a different way of thinking about data access.

### 3. Performance Benchmarking Is Non-Negotiable

One of my key contributions was benchmarking resolver performance under high concurrency. We sustained **330+ requests/sec with zero data loss**—but getting there required systematic testing and optimization.

**The lesson**: Don't guess about performance. Measure it, prove it, document it.

## The Technical Challenges

### Building the Dynamic SQL Query Builder

The N+1 query problem is a classic GraphQL challenge. My solution was a dynamic SQL query builder that:
- Analyzed the incoming GraphQL query
- Generated optimized SQL with proper joins
- Implemented caching strategies for repeated patterns

Result: **25% improvement in database throughput**.

### Working Within the AWS Coral Framework

AWS has its own internal frameworks and conventions. Learning to build within the Coral framework while maintaining code that could integrate with existing distributed microservices was a constant balance.

When joining a new team, spend the first week just reading code. Understanding existing patterns will save you from reinventing wheels—or worse, building incompatible ones.

## What I'd Tell Past Me

1. **Documentation is a feature**. The systems I built will outlive my time on the team. Good documentation ensures they remain maintainable.

2. **Ask questions early**. I wasted time on problems that senior engineers could have solved in minutes. There's no prize for struggling alone.

3. **Container everything**. Docker wasn't just for deployment—it was essential for consistent development and testing across the team.

4. **The design is the hard part**. Writing code is straightforward once you've designed the right solution. Most of my time was spent in design docs and architecture discussions.

5. **Celebrate the wins**. Getting the design adopted for production integration was a highlight of my career so far. Take time to appreciate these moments.

## Looking Forward

I'm heading back to NC State with a clearer understanding of what "production-grade software" really means. The technical skills matter, but equally important are:
- Systematic thinking about scale
- Clear communication in design documents
- Rigorous testing and benchmarking
- Building for maintainability, not just functionality

To anyone preparing for their first big tech internship: you're probably more ready than you think. The fundamentals transfer—algorithms, data structures, system design. What you'll learn is how to apply them at scale.

Good luck.
