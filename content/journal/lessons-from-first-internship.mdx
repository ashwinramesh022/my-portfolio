Three months at Amazon felt like a year of learning compressed into a summer. As I wrap up my internship and head back to school, I want to capture the lessons while they're fresh—both for my future self and for anyone preparing for their first big tech experience.

## The Surprises

### 1. The Codebase Is Massive (And That's Okay)

I expected a large codebase. I didn't expect to feel completely lost for the first two weeks. The Amazon monorepo is vast, the tooling is custom, and the documentation... exists in various states of completeness.

**The lesson**: You're not supposed to understand everything immediately. The skill is learning *how* to navigate, not memorizing the map. I got comfortable with:

- Reading code as a primary learning tool
- Asking "dumb" questions early (they're never dumb)
- Building a personal knowledge base of things I discovered

### 2. Shipping Is Hard

In school, I was used to building features and calling them done when the tests passed. At Amazon, that's maybe 30% of the work.

The rest is:
- Writing documentation
- Getting code reviews (multiple rounds)
- Handling edge cases you never considered
- Monitoring after deployment
- Communicating changes to stakeholders

**The lesson**: Writing code is the easy part. Engineering is about the entire lifecycle.

### 3. Senior Engineers Are Incredibly Generous

I was intimidated by the senior engineers at first. These are people building systems at a scale I'd only read about. But overwhelmingly, they were eager to help.

The catch? You have to ask. And you have to ask well.

```
Bad: "This doesn't work, can you help?"
Good: "I'm trying to achieve X. I tried Y and Z, but I'm seeing 
      this error. My hypothesis is W. Am I on the right track?"
```

**The lesson**: Show that you've tried, show your thinking, and people will go out of their way to help you.

## The Challenges

### Imposter Syndrome Is Real

Every intern I talked to felt it. The sense that everyone else knows what they're doing and you're the only one faking it. 

What helped me:
- Remembering that I was *hired* to learn, not to know everything
- Tracking my wins, even small ones
- Talking honestly with other interns (they felt it too)

### Context-Switching Is Exhausting

Meetings, code reviews, planning sessions, Slack messages, actual coding—the mental overhead of switching between tasks was something I underestimated.

I started:
- Blocking "focus time" on my calendar
- Batching similar tasks together
- Being honest about capacity in standups

### The Timeline Pressure

My internship project had a deadline. The work didn't always fit the deadline. Learning to scope, cut features, and communicate proactively about delays was uncomfortable but essential.

<Callout type="tip" title="Pro tip">
Raise risks early. Managers would rather know about potential delays with time to adjust than be surprised at the last minute.
</Callout>

## What I'd Tell Past Me

If I could send a message back to day-one-of-internship me:

1. **Document everything**. You'll forget more than you expect. Keep notes on what you learned, who you talked to, and what worked.

2. **Take initiative on small things**. Found a typo in the docs? Fix it. See a small improvement? Propose it. These build trust and demonstrate ownership.

3. **Build relationships beyond your team**. The coffee chats, the random Slack conversations—these matter more than you think.

4. **It's okay to not finish**. Your value isn't just the code you ship. It's the learning you demonstrate and the foundation you build.

5. **Enjoy it**. Yes, it's intense. But you're getting paid to learn from some of the best engineers in the world. That's pretty incredible.

## Looking Forward

I'm heading back to school with a return offer and a completely different perspective on what "being an engineer" means. The technical skills matter, but they're maybe 50% of the job. The rest is communication, judgment, and continuous learning.

To anyone preparing for their first internship: you're probably more ready than you think. And even if you feel lost at first, that's normal. The goal isn't to know everything—it's to learn how to learn in a new environment.

Good luck.
